# AlgorithmzSolutios
This is where I keep the solutions for the algorithms and data structures and interview questions, all developed by me

### newest:
both recursive and iterative methods to find Kth smallest and largest nodes in BST.
in The **Recursive methods** since we are returning the accumulator value for the next calculation, once the accumulator value equals the k, since this is not a void returning method, return will not terminate the method  --> some solutions

System.exit(0); This just terminates JVM, in some cases it might be OK, but for our purpose, we need to make the cursor node null and catch the null pointer exception in the main solution.


#### Polish notation
This one solves the polish notation calculation:
**for bounus** I tuned the solution to accomodate the numbers greater than 9, it calculates all numbers nou just digits!!! :sunglasses:


# Big Integer:
you can *literally* calculate the fibbonacci of 2020 in less than a second. :fast_forward: :fast_forward:


## Round the Table:
finding closest neighbors in a circular array.
